### **Project Title:**
**Top 10 Binge-Watch Movies**

### **Project Overview:**
This project is a web application where users can create, manage, and personalize a list of their top 10 binge-watch movies. The list will be dynamic and changeable based on user preferences, with the option to add, update, and remove movies. Additionally, users will receive movie recommendations tailored to their tastes, making this a fun and interactive way to discover new movies to watch. The application will focus on user authentication, CRUD operations, and a user-friendly interface.

### **Key Features:**
1. **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up, login, and session management to ensure personalized experiences.
2. **Movie List Management**: Users can add, update, and delete movies in their personal top 10 list.
3. **Movie Search & Filter**: Ability to search for movies by genre, rating, and other categories to customize the list.
4. **Recommendations**: Personalized movie suggestions based on the user's genre preferences and viewing history.
5. **Responsive UI**: Fully mobile-responsive design for an optimal viewing experience on any device.
6. **API Integration**: Backend API for handling CRUD operations and communication with the frontend.
7. **Rating System**: Users can rate movies in their list and view average ratings.
8. **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, update, and delete movie entries via API calls.

### **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js** (with Vite for faster setup and development)
  - **HTML/CSS** for basic styling and layout
  - **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design and pre-built components
  - **Axios** for making API requests to the backend
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js** with **Express.js** for building the REST API
  - **MongoDB** (using **Mongoose**) for managing the movie data and user preferences
  - **JWT** or **session storage** for user authentication and secure login
- **Deployment**:
  - **Heroku** or **Netlify** for deploying the backend and frontend respectively
  - **Postman** for testing the API during development
### **Why This Project:**
Iâ€™ve chosen this project because it combines fun (movies!) with essential web development skills. The interactive nature of the project will help me learn and practice both backend and frontend development, and the features like user authentication, CRUD operations, and personalized recommendations will provide valuable experience in full-stack development. 
Moreover, I believe that working on this project will give me hands-on exposure to modern technologies such as React, Express, and MongoDB. Itâ€™s a practical project that I can use as a portfolio piece, and itâ€™s also something I can continuously improve by adding more complex features (like background jobs, caching, or advanced recommendations). 
I find this project interesting because it combines entertainment with technology and is something many people would enjoy using to discover new content. It will also help me deepen my understanding of database management, API development, and frontend interactivity.
Milestone 7 Summary
In this milestone, we implemented user login authentication by validating credentials and comparing encrypted passwords using bcrypt. The process involves retrieving user data, hashing the entered password, and matching it with the stored hash. If authenticated, access is granted; otherwise, an error is returned. This enhances security and protectsÂ userÂ data.Â ðŸš€
